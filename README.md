# Collaborative and intercommunicated mobile cyber-physical system

The activities of this project include:
1. Long Range communications protocol implemented in actual LoRa transceivers that aim to transmit low-frequency data between them.

2. Randomly generated data (Syntetic data) using consistent values from a previous research of variables of interest and real-time readings for a simple sensor station to simulate real data. 

3. The design of a HMI that can showcase a dashboard of selected variables, implemented in InfluxDB. (TCP based). For a visualization of data in real-time.
   - Variables sucha as:
     - Weather variables as Temperature and Humidity
     - An interruption Alarm
     - Distance from an object
     - GPS position
     - IMU information
     - Speed of the vehicle
     - Fuel level
